## Project Overview

During the training, I explored various projects and organized my work meticulously. I created dedicated folders for each technology—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—ensuring that every mini-project and useful piece of information was saved to aid in the development of the final project.

### Highlights
- **HTML, CSS, JS Projects**: Special folders for each technology containing individual projects and useful resources.
- **Final Project**: Developed an Instagram clone using React, showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired during the training.
